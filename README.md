Deep Learning: Training a Convolutional Neural Network with Keras to Recognize Each of the Five Members of the Simpson Family.

In this project, we delve into the realm of deep learning, employing Keras to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the primary objective of accurately recognizing each of the five members 
constituting the Simpson family. Through meticulous training and leveraging advanced neural network architectures, we aim to achieve high precision in identifying characters such as Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie Simpson.
