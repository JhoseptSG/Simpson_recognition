Deep Learning: Training a Convolutional Neural Network with Keras to Recognize Each of the Five Members of the Simpson Family.

In this project, we delve into the realm of deep learning, employing Keras to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the primary objective of accurately recognizing each of the five members 
constituting the Simpson family. Through meticulous training and leveraging advanced neural network architectures, we aim to achieve high precision in identifying characters such as Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and 
Maggie Simpson. 

For this task, I've acquired a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset), where each image is labeled with just one character from the Simpson family. Predominantly, the majority of images predominantly feature a single 
character, facilitating a straightforward assignment of each image to a specific character.

It's noteworthy that the dataset encompasses a broader array of Simpson family characters beyond the selected five. However, owing to time constraints, I've opted to streamline the training process by focusing solely on the principal characters. This decision ensures a more efficient training pipeline, emphasizing the recognition accuracy of the primary charactersâ€”Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie Simpson.
